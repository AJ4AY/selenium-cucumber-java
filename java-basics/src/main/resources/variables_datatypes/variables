Types of Variable

There are three types of variables in java

 1 local variable
 2 instance variable
 3 static variable

*-Local Variable-A variable that is declared inside the method is called local variable.

*-Instance Variable- A variable that is declared inside the class but outside the method is called instance variable . It is not declared as static.


*-Static variable-A variable that is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local.
  We will have detailed learning of these variables in next chapters.


  * declaring a variable

  int a;
  String anwar;

  Declaring multiple variables

  int a,b,c;
  String Atif,Anwar,Sanjeev,Fawad;


 * Initializing a variable

  int a=1;
  int b=null;

  String Anwar= "Selenium Expert";



Following are valid examples of variable declaration and initialization in Java:

int a, b, c;         // Declares three ints, a, b, and c.
int a = 10, b = 10;  // Example of initialization
byte B = 22;         // initializes a byte type variable B.
double pi = 3.14159; // declares and assigns a value of PI.
char a = 'a';        // the char variable a iis initialized with value 'a'
