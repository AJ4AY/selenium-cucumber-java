**********Classes And Objects***********8

-A Class defines the blueprint for an Object. OR Collections of objects

-An Object is made up of Data Types and Functions.

-Every function has a behaviour

-We can access data within an Object via its Properties. With Functions, we can manipulate the state of an Object.

-An Object’s  Properties and its associated Data is considered to be the building blocks any Object Oriented Programming Language.


-We can restrict access to a class, its methods and properties.

-By limiting access, we ENCAPSULATE implementation of a feature.

-We hide implementation of certain features so as not to overburden users of our implementation with too much detail.

-Restriction can also prevents prohibited access to certain class functionalities.
