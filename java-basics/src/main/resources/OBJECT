***************Objects Model Reality***********


A classic exemplification of how an object mimics reality can be seen in Cars.

Cars have properties such as make, model, colour, engine size, shape etc.

It also has methods associated with it such as moving forward, Moving backwards,  turning headlights on in the dark, Stopping when breaks are applied etc.

If we were to define a base Car Class, all future cars we attempt to create can inherit from this generic Car Class.

This speeds-up the creation of a new Car as we don’t have to design it from scratch.
